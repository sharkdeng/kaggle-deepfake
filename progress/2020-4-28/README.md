1) training strategy
Previous two days, I encountered a weird problem, EfficientNet train loss decrease very slowly. <br>
Now I trained the network on 10000 images, got 0.01 training loss. I am gonna use momentum model to do training, to speed uo loss decrease and save time. <br>
I am gonna check if this work. 

2) I have tested the Xception network correctness and learning ability, I am gonna transplant this model to my 98493 dataset.
